Project Idea: Task Management Application

Description:
Create a web-based task management application using ASP.NET Core and C#. This project will allow users to create, manage, and organize tasks, making it a valuable tool for personal productivity or team collaboration.

Key Features:

User Authentication: Implement user authentication and authorization to ensure secure access to the application. Users should be able to register, log in, and reset their passwords.

Task Creation: Users can create new tasks with details such as title, description, due date, priority, and status (e.g., to-do, in progress, completed).

Task List: Display a list of tasks for each user, organized by status (e.g., to-do, in progress, completed). Implement filtering and sorting options for tasks.

Task Editing: Allow users to edit task details, update the status, and mark tasks as completed.

Task Categories/Labels: Implement a feature that enables users to categorize tasks with labels or categories. Users should be able to assign one or more labels to each task.

Search and Filter: Provide a search functionality to quickly find tasks by keywords or filter tasks by various criteria (e.g., due date, priority, category).

User Profiles: Users can view and update their profiles, including profile pictures and personal information.

Notifications: Implement notifications (e.g., email notifications or in-app notifications) for task deadlines or updates.

Dashboard: Create a user-friendly dashboard that displays statistics about completed tasks, upcoming tasks, and other relevant information.

Responsive Design: Ensure that the application is responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

Testing: Write unit tests and integration tests to ensure the reliability and correctness of your code.

Deployment: Deploy the application to a cloud platform like Azure or AWS and provide instructions on how to run it locally.

Documentation: Create clear and concise documentation, including a README file with setup instructions and a description of the project.

By developing a task management application with these features, you can demonstrate your proficiency in ASP.NET Core, C#, user authentication, database management (you can use Entity Framework Core for this), responsive web design, and testing. Additionally, it's a practical project that can be useful in real-life scenarios.

Remember to regularly commit your code to GitHub and maintain good coding practices, such as code comments and meaningful commit messages. This project should not only showcase your technical skills but also your ability to create a user-friendly and well-documented application.
